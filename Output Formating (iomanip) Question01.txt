Write a program to input the marks a student for two assignments and find the final mark of each 
assignment according to the percentages given. In your program;

1) Implement a function to find the contribution of each assignment mark sent to the function 
   as parameters. In the function you should update two variables called CA1 and CA2, which
   are defined in the main program. The function heading is given below;

void findMarks (int t_marks1, int t_marks2, float &t_CA1, float &t_CA2);

The final CA mark for each assignment is calculated as shown below;

       Assignment 1 20%
       Assignment 2 30%

2) In the main program, input marks for 5 students and show the percentages of the marks 
   using findMarks() function in a table as shown below. Format the output to 2 decimal 
   places.

          Student  Marks1  Marks2  CA_1   CA_2
             1      60       65    12.00  19.50
             2      37       43    7.40   12.90
             3      75       80    15.00  24.00
             4      92       75    18.40  22.50
             5      53       45    10.60  15.9
